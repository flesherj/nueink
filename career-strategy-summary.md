# Career Strategy & Equity Negotiation Summary
*Date: November 2024*

## Current Situation

**Your Role:**
- Title: Senior Software Engineer (~4 years at current company)
- Reports to: Technical founder
- Leadership team member
- Recently accepted management of 1 engineer (last 2 weeks)
- Current comp: ~$200K total compensation
- Current equity: Unknown (vesting soon) - estimated ~1%

**What You've Built:**
- DTC application frontend (from scratch, production)
- Native mobile application (built and deployed to first customer)
- Platform architecture (foundation for 4+ applications)
- Shared UI component library
- All while backend was handled by other team members

**Company Context:**
- Revenue-positive health tech startup
- White-label patient engagement apps for lab partners
- Large patient database (several million patients)
- Recent funding round
- DTC application growing rapidly
- Built data infrastructure but project stalled
- Life sciences data monetization is strategic priority

## The Opportunity Identified

**The Asset:**
- Multi-million patient database
- Currently only showing basic results
- Not enriched for research/life sciences use

**The Strategy:**
Add free patient-facing features to enrich the data, then monetize to life sciences companies.

**Phase 1 (3-6 months): Patient Data Enrichment**
- Medication tracking
- Health timeline and document management
- Smart insights and correlations
- OCR for document extraction
- Target: 15-30% patient adoption

**Phase 2 (6-12 months): Life Sciences Monetization**
- Clinical trial patient recruitment partnerships
- Real-world evidence (RWD) data licensing
- Research query platform
- Target: Significant revenue potential (7-8 figures)

**Phase 3 (12-18+ months): Scale & Provider Platform**
- Higher patient enrichment rates
- Provider ordering platform with patient context
- Target: Major new revenue stream

**Revenue Model Comparisons:**
- Similar companies with smaller databases have generated 9-figure revenues
- Companies in this space have been acquired for billions
- Your company's database is competitive in size

## Why This Works with White-Label Business Model

**Founders have historically rejected consumer-facing brand because:**
- Current business is white-label for partners
- Partners want their own branding
- Don't want to compete with customers

**The solution:**
- Keep white-label front-end (patients see partner branding)
- Build unified back-end platform with enriched data
- Patients get free valuable features
- With consent, aggregate de-identified data monetized to life sciences
- Partners don't compete in research data market
- Potentially offer partners revenue share

**Three-sided platform:**
1. **Patients:** Free health tracking tools
2. **Life Sciences:** Pay for de-identified aggregate research data
3. **Providers:** (Future) Pay for ordering platform with complete patient context

## What You Actually Want

**NOT trying to:**
- Take over strategy from founders
- Claim credit for identifying opportunity
- Make dramatic leap in role
- Damage relationships

**Actually trying to:**
- Get recognized for work already done
- Be fairly compensated for current scope
- Natural role progression (Senior → Director)
- Execute on data enrichment product work
- Maintain collaborative relationships
- Increase equity to benefit from company success

## The Collaborative Approach

**Your scope should be:**
- ✅ Product execution (patient-facing features)
- ✅ Engineering delivery (build on platform you created)
- ✅ Data product development
- ✅ Team management (grow team)

**NOT your scope:**
- ❌ Life sciences business development
- ❌ Overall data strategy
- ❌ Partnership sales

**Your value proposition:**
- "Founders identified opportunity and built infrastructure"
- "Project needs product and engineering execution"
- "I can ship the patient features to unlock the value"
- "I've proven execution with existing work"

## Game Plan (November - February)

### Week 1-2: Casual Check-in with Manager

**Don't schedule formal meeting. Just grab 15 min casually:**

"Hey, quick question - I've been thinking about the data enrichment project. That feels like it would be a natural fit with the work I've been doing. Is that something you're thinking I could help drive, or is there someone else leading that product work?"

**Then listen.**

**Key: No pressure. Just planting a seed.**

### November - January: Build Track Record

1. **Deliver on management role** (3 months of proven leadership)
2. **Keep apps running smoothly** (don't let existing work slip)
3. **Optional: Prototype feature** to show concept

### Early January: Find Out Current Equity

Ask HR or whoever handles equity for complete details:
- Current equity percentage
- Vesting schedule
- Strike price (if options) or type (if RSUs)
- Company valuation
- Fully-diluted share count

### Mid-Late January: Prepare One-Page Review Doc

**For yourself (not to share):**
1. What I've Built
2. Current Scope
3. What I'm Asking For
4. Why This Is Fair
5. Open to Discussion On

### February Review: The Conversation

**Opening:**

"I'd like to talk about role and compensation alignment. I've been thinking about how my scope has evolved and want to make sure we're aligned."

**Share what you've built:**

"Over the past 18 months I've built [list applications], created the platform architecture, and recently taken on management. [If discussed] And we've talked about me leading the patient data enrichment product work."

**State what you want:**

"That scope feels like it's grown beyond Senior Engineer. I'm doing platform architecture, product ownership, and managing a team. I'd like to discuss formalizing this as Director of Product Engineering."

**Pause. Let them respond.**

**When comp comes up:**

"On the equity side, I'd like to discuss an adjustment that reflects this scope. I'm currently at [X]%, and market comp for Director-level at a revenue-positive company is typically 2-4% total. I'd like to discuss getting to that range with additional equity vesting over 4 years.

I'm open to milestone-based structure tied to shipping features and hitting targets.

On salary, I'd like to discuss an adjustment to market rate, or keeping salary flat and adjusting more on equity if that's preferred."

**Then stop talking.**

## Fair Compensation Framework

**Current state (estimated):**
- Title: Senior Software Engineer
- Equity: ~1%
- Salary: ~$200K total comp
- Scope: Built multiple apps, platform, managing engineer

**What you're asking for:**
- Title: Director of Product Engineering
- Equity: 3-3.5% total (+2-2.5% additional)
- Salary: Market rate for Director (+$10-30K or keep flat)
- Scope: Platform + product + management + data initiative

**Why this is fair:**
- Already doing Director-level work
- Market comp for Director: 2-4% equity
- Taking on more scope (data enrichment, growing team)
- Milestone-based vesting reduces company risk
- **Conservative, not aggressive**

## Realistic Outcomes

**Best case:**
- Director title immediately
- +2.5% equity (→ 3.5% total)
- Salary increase to market rate
- **Feel great**

**Good case:**
- Director title in 6 months
- +2% equity now, more with milestones
- Modest salary increase
- **Still a win**

**Acceptable case:**
- Staff Engineer title (intermediate step)
- +1.5-2% equity
- Salary increase
- Clear path to Director
- **Progress**

**Not acceptable:**
- No title change
- <1% equity increase
- Minimal salary increase
- Vague promises
- **Signal to explore market**

## Key Reminders

**Relationship preservation principles:**
1. Position as collaboration
2. Give credit generously
3. Ask, don't demand
4. Be open to feedback
5. Frame as win-win

**What you're NOT doing:**
- ❌ Going around manager
- ❌ Claiming to own strategy
- ❌ Demanding overnight promotion
- ❌ Being aggressive

**What you ARE doing:**
- ✅ Working through manager
- ✅ Focusing on execution
- ✅ Asking for natural progression
- ✅ Being collaborative and patient

3. Current company valuation?
4. Current revenue run rate?

**About your equity:**
1. Current equity percentage (fully diluted)
2. Vesting schedule
3. Options vs RSUs?
4. Strike price if options
5. Total outstanding shares

## Final Thoughts

You've been doing Director-level work while being paid as a Senior Engineer. Asking for fair compensation is not greedy - it's appropriate.

The patient database is a valuable asset that needs product execution to unlock. You're the natural person to lead execution based on work you've already proven you can deliver.

**Trust yourself. You've earned this.**
