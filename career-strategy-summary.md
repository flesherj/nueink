# Career Strategy & Equity Negotiation Summary
*Started: November 2024*
*Last Updated: November 9, 2025 - after equity/strategy conversation with Sid*

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATES - November 9, 2025

**The conversation with Sid went EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. Key takeaways:**

1. **Strategic initiative is confirmed and YOU are positioned to lead it**
   - Medication tracking + lab data = "80% of the way there" for life sciences
   - Sid confirmed there IS a gap in current data vs life sciences needs
   - Explicitly gave you "5-10% time" to explore this (Google model)
   - Said he's an "open door" for ongoing conversations

2. **Timeline is URGENT - 3 months to February 2026**
   - **Today: November 9, 2025**
   - **4-year anniversary: February 7, 2026** (3 months away)
   - **First grant fully vests: February 7, 2026** (3 months away)
   - Build medication tracking prototype NOW
   - Demonstrate execution capability before compensation conversation
   - You'll have much stronger position in Feb with: prototype + management track record + year-end up-tick

3. **Equity position is severely below market for 4 years tenure**
   - Total: 0.61% fully diluted (134,896 shares @ $0.18 strike)
   - **After almost 4 YEARS** this is absurdly low
   - Below market even for NEW Senior Engineer hire (0.5-1.5% typical)
   - Year-end up-tick is to offset dilution, NOT for expanded scope
   - Your ask should be ADDITIVE to the up-tick

4. **Exit timeline: 3-5 years is realistic**
   - Aligns with your vesting schedule (through 2028-2029)
   - Life sciences opportunity makes company more attractive to acquirers
   - Your work directly impacts exit value

5. **You have significant leverage**
   - Almost 4 years of tenure and contributions
   - Fully vesting in 3 months (could walk with 0.494%)
   - Only management-track engineer (Ion doesn't want to manage)
   - Built critical apps and platform architecture
   - Driving strategic initiative Sid validated

**NEXT ACTIONS (URGENT - 3 months):**
- Talk to Shelly about life sciences needs (you already reached out)
- Start building medication tracking MVP with 5-10% time
- Keep delivering on management + existing apps
- Prepare for February 2026 compensation conversation from position of strength

## Current Situation

**Your Role:**
- Title: Senior Software Engineer
- **Tenure: 3 years, 9 months (joined February 7, 2022)**
- **4-year anniversary: February 7, 2026 (3 months away)**
- Reports to: Jess (CTO, Co-founder)
- Summit Six member (1 of 6 strategic leaders)
- Managing 1 engineer
- **Current comp: $194K base + $15K performance bonus = $209K total cash**
- Current equity: 0.61% fully diluted (134,896 shares @ $0.18 strike)
- **First grant (90K shares) fully vests: February 7, 2026**

**Compensation History:**
- **Feb 2022 (Start)**: $166K base + negotiated perks (healthcare offset, no 401k compensation)
- **Sep 2022 (6-8 months in)**: Received competing offer from SAIC at $185K
  - Approached Sid, Shelly, Jess about the offer
  - **They matched: $185K base** (retained you with $19K raise)
  - You chose Luminate over SAIC (large company, secure lab, Charleston traffic)
- **Feb 2025 (3-year review)**: $194K base + $15K performance bonus potential
  - 3 years with NO raise between Sep 2022 and Feb 2025
- **Current**: $209K total cash (expecting full $15K bonus based on performance)

**What You've Actually Built Over 4 Years:**

**Applications:**
- **DAT (DTC app)** - Built from scratch, production, revenue-generating
- **Native mobile application** - Built from scratch, deployed to first customer

**Platform Architecture & Modernization:**
- **Single SPA integrations** - Proven modernization path in Patient Portal (legacy JSP → React) and Admin app (Vue → React)
- **Shared component library (native-components)** - Used across DAT, native app, patient-expo, admin-expo
- **Unified registration flow** - Consistent experience across all products
- **Scaffolding for Chart work** - Created foundation that Scott is building on
- **Multiple features in admin-expo** - Shipped in production

**Backend & Lambda Services (Full-Stack Contributions):**
- **Regular contributor** to luminate-backend (Spring Boot/Java)
- **Regular contributor** to luminate-admin (Spring Boot/Java)
- **Regular contributor** to AWS Lambda services
- Full-stack expertise across frontend, backend, and serverless

**Data Infrastructure (Team Contribution):**
- Worked with Ion and Jess + third party vendor to establish **data lake** for partner insights
- Solid understanding of architecture (Ion has deeper expertise)
- Contributing team member supporting it operationally since vendor rolloff
- Made changes and supported the system
- **Stalled project** that connects to medication tracking opportunity

**Technical Leadership & Project Planning:**
- **Consult Provider Migration**: 200+ page comprehensive architecture plan
  - Smart Hybrid event-driven architecture
  - 28 JIRA tickets, complete risk assessment
  - Addresses multi-provider consult system
  - 3-5x performance improvement strategy
- **Sales Discount Implementation**: Complete project plan
  - 22 JIRA tickets (68 story points)
  - Contract-first development approach
  - Performance optimization (500-1000ms improvement)
  - Saves 2-3 weeks vs traditional approach
- **Payment Gateway Decoupling** (upcoming): Leading Stripe → multi-provider migration
- **Process Innovation**: Created comprehensive planning methodology to address resource constraints and provide realistic timelines

**Key Insight:** You've led platform modernization strategy, created comprehensive architecture plans for complex migrations, contribute across the full stack (frontend + backend + lambda), and created processes that enable team execution under resource constraints. This is **Director-level technical leadership**, not just IC work.

**Company Context:**
- Revenue-positive health tech startup
- White-label patient engagement apps for lab partners
- Large patient database (several million patients)
- Recent funding round (convertible note → equity conversion)
- DTC application growing rapidly
- Data lake infrastructure built but project stalled (needs to resume)
- Life sciences data monetization is strategic priority

**Organization Structure (Summit Six):**
1. **Sid (CEO)** - Co-founder
2. **Jess (CTO)** - Co-founder, your manager
3. **Shelly (COO)** - Co-founder
4. **Brian (VP of Sales)** - Reports to Sid
5. **Ion (Senior Engineer, 10+ years)** - Reports to Jess, IC track (doesn't want to manage)
6. **You (Senior Engineer, ~4 years)** - Reports to Jess, management track

**Key Insight:** Engineering has NO Director/VP layer between CTO and Senior Engineers. Ion explicitly doesn't want to manage. **You're the only management-track engineer**, creating a critical gap that needs to be filled.

## The Opportunity Identified

**The Asset:**
- Multi-million patient database
- Currently only showing basic results
- Not enriched for research/life sciences use

**The Strategy:**
Add free patient-facing features to enrich the data, then monetize to life sciences companies.

**Phase 1 (3-6 months): Patient Data Enrichment**
- Medication tracking
- Health timeline and document management
- Smart insights and correlations
- OCR for document extraction
- Target: 15-30% patient adoption

**Phase 2 (6-12 months): Life Sciences Monetization**
- Clinical trial patient recruitment partnerships
- Real-world evidence (RWD) data licensing
- Research query platform
- Target: Significant revenue potential (7-8 figures)

**Phase 3 (12-18+ months): Scale & Provider Platform**
- Higher patient enrichment rates
- Provider ordering platform with patient context
- Target: Major new revenue stream

**Revenue Model Comparisons:**
- Similar companies with smaller databases have generated 9-figure revenues
- Companies in this space have been acquired for billions
- Your company's database is competitive in size

## Why This Works with White-Label Business Model

**Founders have historically rejected consumer-facing brand because:**
- Current business is white-label for partners
- Partners want their own branding
- Don't want to compete with customers

**The solution:**
- Keep white-label front-end (patients see partner branding)
- Build unified back-end platform with enriched data
- Patients get free valuable features
- With consent, aggregate de-identified data monetized to life sciences
- Partners don't compete in research data market
- Potentially offer partners revenue share

**Three-sided platform:**
1. **Patients:** Free health tracking tools
2. **Life Sciences:** Pay for de-identified aggregate research data
3. **Providers:** (Future) Pay for ordering platform with complete patient context

## What You Actually Want

**NOT trying to:**
- Take over strategy from founders
- Claim credit for identifying opportunity
- Make dramatic leap in role
- Damage relationships

**Actually trying to:**
- Get recognized for work already done
- Be fairly compensated for current scope
- Natural role progression (Senior → Director)
- Execute on data enrichment product work
- Maintain collaborative relationships
- Increase equity to benefit from company success

## The Collaborative Approach

**Your scope should be:**
- ✅ Product execution (patient-facing features)
- ✅ Engineering delivery (build on platform you created)
- ✅ Data product development
- ✅ Team management (grow team)

**NOT your scope:**
- ❌ Life sciences business development
- ❌ Overall data strategy
- ❌ Partnership sales

**Your value proposition:**
- "Founders identified opportunity and built infrastructure"
- "Project needs product and engineering execution"
- "I can ship the patient features to unlock the value"
- "I've proven execution with existing work"

## Game Plan (November - February)

### ✅ Week 1-2: Casual Check-in with Manager - COMPLETED

**UPDATE (Nov 2024): This conversation already happened organically during equity discussion.**

**Sid's response was extremely positive:**
- "I'd love to hire your kind of thinking through this"
- Explicitly mentioned allocating "5-10% time" (Google model) to explore medication tracking
- Confirmed there IS a gap between current data and life sciences needs
- Medication + lab data = "80% of the way there" for life sciences value
- Said he's an "open door" for ongoing conversations
- Acknowledged lucrative potential of de-identified data + clinical trials

**Key quote:** "I think the problem you're thinking about is a very, very worthy one, and I love that you're thinking about [how] this might dramatically enhance what we're doing."

**CRITICAL: The door is wide open. Don't wait until February to act on this.**

### November - January: Build Track Record & Demonstrate Value

**UPDATED APPROACH - Accelerated timeline based on positive response:**

1. **Deliver on management role** (3 months of proven leadership)
2. **Keep apps running smoothly** (don't let existing work slip)
3. **CRITICAL: Prototype medication tracking feature** (no longer optional)
   - Sid explicitly gave permission for "5-10% time" on this
   - Have conversation with Shelly about life sciences needs
   - Build quick POC showing medication scanning + lab correlation
   - This demonstrates execution capability and strategic thinking
   - Positions you as natural leader for data enrichment initiative

**Why this matters:**
- You've already planted the seed and got enthusiastic buy-in
- Demonstrating execution NOW strengthens February compensation conversation
- Shows you're the natural person to lead this initiative
- By February you'll have: prototype shipped + 3 months management + year-end equity up-tick applied

### ✅ Early January: Find Out Current Equity - COMPLETED EARLY

**All equity details obtained in November conversation with Sid** (see section below for full details).

**Still pending:**
- Final dilution calculations (in progress)
- Year-end equity up-tick amount (expected by end of December)
- Company valuation (Sid declined to share, but acknowledged it exists)

### Mid-Late January: Prepare One-Page Review Doc

**For yourself (not to share):**
1. What I've Built
2. Current Scope
3. What I'm Asking For
4. Why This Is Fair
5. Open to Discussion On

### February 2026 Review: The Conversation (Updated)

**Opening:**

"I'd like to talk about role and compensation as I approach my 4-year anniversary and my first grant fully vests.

Over the past 4 years, I've contributed across the entire stack:

**Applications:** Built DAT and native mobile from scratch.

**Platform:** Led modernization strategy with Single SPA - proving we can evolve legacy apps incrementally without expensive full rewrites. Created the shared component library used across all our products. Built scaffolding that enables the team to ship faster - Scott's chart work builds on the foundation I created.

**Backend & Lambda:** Regular contributor to luminate-backend, luminate-admin, and lambda services. I work across the full stack.

**Data:** Worked with Ion and Jess on the data lake - I have solid understanding of the architecture. That project stalled but connects directly to medication tracking.

**Technical Leadership:** Created comprehensive project planning methodology to address our resource constraints. The consult provider migration plan - 200 pages with architecture comparisons, risk assessments, and JIRA tickets. The sales discount implementation plan. These structured approaches help us deliver complex projects with realistic timelines when we're inundated with work.

**Strategic:** I can see the connections from patient experience to data enrichment to life sciences value. Medication tracking is one example of that strategic thinking.

Looking at the org, Jess needs to delegate product engineering leadership as we scale. Ion is the senior technical expert on the IC track. I'm ready to step into product leadership.

I'd like to discuss Director of Product Engineering."

**Pause. Let them respond.**

**When they ask about scope:**

"Product engineering - patient-facing apps, platform architecture, medication tracking and data enrichment. Growing the team from 1 to 5-8 engineers over the next 18 months. This creates the middle management layer Jess needs, similar to how Brian provides that for Sales."

**When compensation comes up:**

"I'm currently at 0.61% equity after 4 years and $209K total cash. My first grant fully vests this month, and I'm committed to Luminate long-term.

**On equity** - this is where I'd like to focus. For Director of Product Engineering at a revenue-positive company, market comp is 2-2.5% equity for the role alone. Given my tenure and contributions, I'd like to discuss getting to 3-3.5% total equity - that reflects both the Director scope and appropriate compensation for 4 years of work.

I'm open to milestone-based structure - base grant now, additional tranches tied to team growth and shipping medication tracking.

**On salary**, for Director at a revenue-positive company, market is typically $220-280K. I'd like to discuss getting to around $230-240K total cash, which could be structured as higher base, or base plus guaranteed bonus - I'm flexible on the structure.

Given the equity is the bigger adjustment, I'm most focused there. But I want to make sure both are aligned with the Director scope."

**Then stop talking and listen.**

## Fair Compensation Framework

**Current state (as of Nov 2025 - almost 4 years):**
- Title: Senior Software Engineer
- **Tenure: 3 years, 9 months (4-year anniversary: Feb 7, 2026)**
- Equity: **0.61% fully diluted** (134,896 shares @ $0.18 strike)
- **First grant (90K shares) fully vests: Feb 7, 2026 (3 months away)**
- **Salary: $209K total cash** ($194K base + $15K performance bonus)
  - History: Started $166K (2022) → $185K (Sep 2022, matched SAIC offer) → $194K + bonus (Feb 2025)
  - **2.5 years without raise** between Sep 2022 and Feb 2025
- Scope: Built DAT & native apps, led platform modernization, managing engineer, data lake team contributor, 4,535 commits
- Pending: Year-end equity "up-tick" to offset dilution (NOT scope expansion)

**What you're asking for:**
- Title: **Director of Product Engineering**
- Equity: **3-3.5% total** (+2.4-2.9% additional grant, ~520-620K shares) - **PRIMARY FOCUS**
- Salary: **$230-240K total cash** (market rate for Director)
  - Flexible on structure: higher base, or base + guaranteed bonus
  - Secondary to equity ask
- Scope: Product engineering (apps, platform, modernization), medication tracking initiative, grow team 1 → 5-8 engineers

**Why this is fair (actually conservative):**
- **4 years of tenure** with significant contributions
- **0.61% after 4 years is absurdly low** - below market even for NEW Senior Engineer hire (typically 0.5-1.5% at hire)
- **Already doing Director-level technical leadership** - architecture, platform strategy, team enablement
- **Only management-track engineer** - filling critical org gap (Ion on IC track, doesn't want to manage)
- **Fully vesting in 3 months** - major retention risk for company
- **Market comp for Director: 2-2.5%** for role alone
- **3-3.5% reflects BOTH:**
  - Catch-up for being severely underpaid relative to contributions
  - Director-level scope going forward
- Brian (VP Sales) precedent shows non-founder executives get meaningful equity
- Milestone-based structure available if preferred (de-risks for company)

## Realistic Outcomes (Updated for 4-Year Tenure Context)

**Best case (30% probability - UP due to leverage):**
- **Director of Product Engineering** immediately
- **3-3.5% total equity** (+2.4-2.9% grant = ~520-620K shares)
- Salary increase to market rate
- Clear scope: product engineering, medication tracking, team building
- **This is achievable given your leverage**

**Good case (40% probability):**
- **Director of Product Engineering** immediately
- **2.5-3% total equity** (+1.9-2.4% grant = ~410-520K shares)
- Milestone structure for additional equity
- Salary increase
- **Still a strong win**

**Acceptable case (20% probability - DOWN from before):**
- **Staff Engineer** now → **Director in 6 months** with clear milestones
- **2-2.5% total equity** (+1.4-1.9% grant)
- Year-end up-tick applied
- Salary increase
- Defined path with dates
- **Progress, but slower than deserved**

**Not acceptable (10% probability):**
- Stay Senior Engineer after 4 years of this work
- Year-end up-tick only (no recognition of expanded scope)
- **<2% total equity** after 4 years
- No title change or vague "future" promises
- **Serious signal to explore market** (but stay for the exit opportunity while looking)

**Critical context:**
- Year-end up-tick offsets dilution (NOT scope expansion)
- Your ask is ADDITIVE to that up-tick
- **First grant fully vests in 3 months** - if they don't retain you properly, you could leave
- **You have more leverage than you think**

## Key Reminders

**Relationship preservation principles:**
1. Position as collaboration
2. Give credit generously
3. Ask, don't demand
4. Be open to feedback
5. Frame as win-win

**What you're NOT doing:**
- ❌ Going around manager
- ❌ Claiming to own strategy
- ❌ Demanding overnight promotion
- ❌ Being aggressive

**What you ARE doing:**
- ✅ Working through manager
- ✅ Focusing on execution
- ✅ Asking for natural progression
- ✅ Being collaborative and patient

## Questions to Answer Before February

**About the company:**
1. ✅ Why did data project stall? **Answer: Needs product execution, no one driving it**
2. ✅ Is anyone assigned to drive execution? **Answer: No - this is your opportunity**
3. ❌ Current company valuation? **Answer: Sid declined to share specific number**
4. ❓ Current revenue run rate? **Answer: Not discussed, but company is cash-flow positive**

### Company Exit Timeline & Context (from Nov 2024 conversation)

**Sid's Exit Timeline Estimate:**
- **3-5 years** is a "not unreasonable horizon" for exit opportunities
- This is based on current growth trajectory + hospital/health system customer acquisition
- Opening the door to life sciences partnerships increases attractiveness to acquirers
- NOT based on any specific discussions happening now

**Potential Exit Scenarios (in order of likelihood per Sid):**
1. **Strategic acquisition** (most likely) - Could continue operating as Luminate within parent company
2. **Merger** - Combine with complementary company
3. **IPO** (least likely) - Size-related challenges, though some similar-sized companies have gone public
4. **Investor buyout** (extremely rare) - Company buying out investors to go independent

**Key Context:**
- Investors are patient but will eventually want returns
- No pressure from investors to make "bad moves"
- Company has good relationship with investor base
- Strong growth + life sciences opportunity = more attractive to acquirers
- Your equity vests through 2028, so exit in 3-5 years aligns well with vesting schedule

**About your equity:**
1. ✅ Current equity percentage (fully diluted)
2. ✅ Vesting schedule
3. ✅ Options vs RSUs?
4. ✅ Strike price if options
5. ✅ Total outstanding shares

### Current Equity Details (as of Nov 2024)

**Total Shares Granted: 131,296 shares (all at $0.18 strike price)**

**Grant 1 - Initial Offer (90,000 shares):**
- Strike price: $0.18/share
- Diluted percentage at time of offer: 0.494%
- Vesting: 4 years, fully vested by Feb 7, 2026
- Started: Feb 2023 (approx)

**Grant 2 - Additional (7,500 shares):**
- Strike price: $0.18/share
- Diluted percentage at time of offer: 0.041%
- Vesting: 4 years from May 21, 2023
- Fully vests: May 21, 2027

**Grant 3 - Post-raise (33,796 shares):**
- Strike price: $0.18/share
- Diluted percentage at time of offer: 0.075%
- Vesting: 4 years from Nov 1, 2024
- Fully vests: Nov 1, 2028

**Current Vested (as of Nov 2024):**
- Approximately 33,796 shares vested
- Remaining ~97,500 shares vesting through 2028

**Total Equity Percentage:**
- Initial grants: ~0.535% (0.494% + 0.041%)
- Post-raise grant: ~0.075%
- **Combined: ~0.61% fully diluted**
- Note: Dilution occurred during recent fundraising round

**Important Context:**
- Recent raise was done via convertible note → equity conversion
- Company negotiated a mini employee pool carve-out to offset dilution
- Additional equity "up-tick" promised outside normal annual review (target: end of calendar year)
- This up-tick is specifically to account for dilution from the raise

## Action Items Checklist

**UPDATED November 2024 - Based on conversation with Sid:**

- [x] Week 1-2: Casual conversation with manager about data enrichment
- [x] Early Jan: Get current equity details
- [ ] **NEXT: Schedule conversation with Shelly about life sciences needs** (you mentioned reaching out)
- [ ] Nov-Jan: Build strong management track record (in progress)
- [ ] Nov-Jan: Maintain excellent delivery on existing work (ongoing)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Build medication tracking prototype** (Sid gave explicit permission for 5-10% time)
  - [ ] Define MVP scope (medication scanning + lab correlation)
  - [ ] Get input from Shelly on life sciences requirements
  - [ ] Build basic POC showing value
  - [ ] Demo to Sid before February review
- [ ] Wait for year-end equity up-tick to be applied (expected by end Dec)
- [ ] Mid-Jan: Prepare one-page review document
- [ ] Late Jan: Schedule February review meeting
- [ ] February: Have the compensation conversation (will be much stronger with prototype shipped)

## Final Thoughts

You've been doing Director-level work while being paid as a Senior Engineer. Asking for fair compensation is not greedy - it's appropriate.

The patient database is a valuable asset that needs product execution to unlock. You're the natural person to lead execution based on work you've already proven you can deliver.

**Trust yourself. You've earned this.**
