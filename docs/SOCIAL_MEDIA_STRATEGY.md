# Social Media Launch Strategy: Build in Public

## Question 2: Should you start posting now or wait?

**Answer: START NOW - Build in Public from Day 1!** 🚀

**DON'T wait for a finished product. START TODAY.**

---

## Why "Build in Public" Works

### The Traditional Approach (WRONG ❌)

```
Months 1-6: Build in secret
  ↓
Month 7: Launch with finished product
  ↓
Month 8: Try to get attention
  ↓
Result: Crickets 🦗
```

**Problems:**
- No audience when you launch
- Cold start problem
- Launch feels desperate
- No momentum

---

### Build in Public Approach (RIGHT ✅)

```
Day 1: "I'm building a finance app"
  ↓
Week 1: 100 followers
  ↓
Week 4: 500 followers
  ↓
Week 8: 2,000 followers
  ↓
Week 12: LAUNCH to warm audience
  ↓
Result: 1,000+ signups on day 1! 🚀
```

**Benefits:**
- Build audience while building product
- Launch feels like an event
- Warm leads ready to buy
- Community invested in your success

## Your Build-in-Public Strategy

### Week 1: Introduction

**Day 1 (TODAY!):**

**Twitter/X:**
```
I'm building a finance app that solves a problem
every couple has: "Who spent what?"

It's like Instagram for your finances 📸💰

Follow along as I build in public 🧵

#buildinpublic #fintech
```

**TikTok:**
```
[Video: You talking to camera]

"I'm tired of fighting with my wife about money.
So I'm building an app to fix it.

It's like Instagram for finances.
You can comment on spending. 😅

Follow to see if I can pull this off.

Day 1. Let's go."

#buildinpublic #personalfinance
```

**Instagram:**
```

Starting a new project today 👨‍💻

Building a finance app because:
• I have $541K in debt
• My wife and I argue about spending
• Existing apps suck

Follow along as I build NueInk Finance 🚀

#buildinpublic #debtfree #entrepreneur
```

---

**Day 2-3:**

**Twitter:**
```
Day 2 of building NueInk Finance:

Just designed the transaction feed.
It looks like Instagram but for money 💸

What do you think? Too crazy?

[Screenshot of mockup]

#buildinpublic
```

**TikTok:**
```
[Screen recording]

"Here's what the app looks like so far.

Each transaction is like a post.
You can comment on it.
See who spent what.

Day 2 of building in public."
```

---

**Day 4-7:**

**Twitter:**
```
Day 5: Just integrated the YNAB API ✅

Now I can pull in real transactions.
Next up: The social feed.

I'll be testing this with my own $541K debt 😅

#buildinpublic #debtfree
```

**Reddit (r/ynab):**
```
Title: "I'm adding the features YNAB is missing"

I love YNAB but it's missing:
- Receipt scanning
- Knowing who spent what (couples)
- Transaction comments

So I'm building an app that adds these.

Week 1 progress: [screenshots]

Thoughts?
```

---

### Week 2-4: Show Progress

**Weekly cadence:**

**Monday: Weekend Progress**
```
Weekend update on NueInk:
✅ Built transaction feed
✅ Added person tagging
✅ Integrated receipt scanning

This week: Comments system

[Screenshot/video]

Who wants early access? 👀
```

**Wednesday: Behind the Scenes**
```
Building the comment system for NueInk 👨‍💻

The goal: Make money conversations
less awkward for couples.

Instead of "YOU SPENT WHAT?!"
It's "lol coffee again? 😅"

Here's how it works: [video]
```

**Friday: Lessons Learned**
```
Week 2 learnings from building NueInk:

1. People LOVE the social feed idea
2. Receipt scanning is harder than I thought
3. But AWS Textract makes it doable
4. 50 people asked for beta access!

Week 3 plan: Polish the UI
```

---

### Week 4-8: Build Hype

**Tease features:**

```
Sneak peek at NueInk's killer feature 👀

When your partner spends money,
you get notified and can comment.

"Coffee again?? 😅"
"I needed it for my meeting!"

Couples budgeting but make it fun.

[Video demo]

Want early access? Drop a 👋
```

**Share milestones:**
```
Just tested NueInk with my real debt:
$541,657.22 😱

The debt payoff tracker shows:
• 25 months to freedom
• $37K/year in interest
• Snowball vs Avalanche comparison

This is actually helpful. I might pull this off.

[Screenshot]
```

**Ask for feedback:**
```
Quick question for couples:

Would you use an app where you can:
- See partner's spending in real-time
- Comment on transactions
- Tag purchases to who bought them

Or is that too invasive? 🤔

Building NueInk and want honest feedback.
```

**By the time you launch, you'll have:**
