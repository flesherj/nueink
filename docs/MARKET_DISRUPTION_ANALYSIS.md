## Risk Factors: Why This Might NOT Disrupt

### 1. Execution Risk (Medium)
- Building multi-integration is complex
- Receipt OCR must be accurate
- Person tagging UX must be simple
- **Mitigation:** Start with MVP, iterate based on feedback

### 2. Competition Copies You (Medium-High)
- Monarch could add receipts in 6 months
- YNAB could add person tagging
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, build moat, network effects

### 3. Market Doesn't Care (Low)
- Maybe people don't actually want receipts?
- Maybe person tagging is niche?
- **Mitigation:** This is validated (forum requests, surveys)

### 4. Plaid Costs Explode (Low-Medium)
- If you get 10,000 users, Plaid costs increase
- $600-1,000/month at scale
- **Mitigation:** Still profitable, can pass on small increase

### 5. Regulatory Changes (Low)
- Open banking regulations could change
- Privacy laws could complicate
- **Mitigation:** Build compliance in from day 1

**Overall Risk: MANAGEABLE**

## Final Verdict: WILL THIS DISRUPT?

### Yes, if you execute well. Here's why:

**1. Clear feature gaps in market**

- First-mover on unique features
- Multi-integration complexity is barrier
- Brand loyalty through solved pain points

---

## Disruption Likelihood

**Overall Probability:**
- **Chance of getting 1,000+ users:** 70%
- **Chance of getting 10,000+ users:** 40%
- **Chance of becoming market leader (50K+ users):** 15%
- **Chance of acquisition/major success:** 10%

**Expected Value Calculation:**
- 70% × $84K ARR = $59K expected
- 40% × $840K ARR = $336K expected
- 15% × $4.2M ARR = $630K expected
- 10% × $10M+ exit = $1M+ expected
