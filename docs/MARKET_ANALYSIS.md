## Recommendation

### My Assessment: **BUILD IT** 🚀

**Why:**

1. **Low financial risk** ($20-250 first year)
2. **High learning value** (Expo, AWS, product development)
3. **Solves your own problem** (you need this tool)
4. **Market validation exists** (YNAB forum requests)
5. **Reasonable time investment** (100-120 hours for MVP)
6. **Potential upside** (could become $2-5K/month side income)
7. **Low downside** (worst case: you have a custom tool you love)

### Suggested Approach

**Phase 1: Build for Yourself (Month 1-2)**
- Goal: Create tool that saves YOU time
- No pressure, no users, just solve your problem
- Investment: 40-60 hours

**Phase 2: Soft Launch (Month 3)**
- Share on r/ynab as "tool I built for myself"
- Offer free beta to 20-50 users
- Gather feedback
- Investment: 20 hours

**Phase 3: Decision Point (Month 4)**
- If beta users love it → launch paid version
- If interest is lukewarm → keep as personal tool
- If you hate maintaining it → open-source it

**This approach minimizes risk while maximizing learning and optionality.**

## Next Steps

If you decide to proceed:

1. **✅ Build MVP for yourself** (we start here)
2. **📊 Track your own usage** for 30 days
3. **🧪 Beta test** with 10-20 YNAB users
4. **💰 Validate willingness to pay** ($4.99/month)
5. **🚀 Launch if validated** or keep as personal tool

## Bottom Line

**Is this a billion-dollar startup? No.**

**Could this become a $50K+/year side business? Possibly.**

**Will you learn valuable skills and save yourself time? Absolutely.**

**Is the investment worth the potential return? YES.**

The beauty of this project is that success is not binary. Even if you never get a single paying user, you'll have:
- A custom tool that saves you hours per month
- Mobile development experience
- AWS/serverless architecture knowledge
- Product design and user research skills
- Something impressive for your portfolio

And if you DO get paying users? That's just upside.

**My recommendation: Build it. Start with yourself. Share if it works. Scale if there's demand.**
